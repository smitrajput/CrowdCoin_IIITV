# CrowdCoin_IIITV
A decentralized crowdfunding platform based on the ethereum blockchain, as part of the Summer Design Project, 2018 at IIIT-V.

The project is a decentralized crowdfunding application, built to solve the problem of money being misused by people, collected using the traditional crowdfunding applications. The application is built with the help of blockchain technology, which, in a
nutshell, can be considered as a decentralized immutable database. This technology helped in keeping track of the money collected using the application, and storing it under the control of a piece of code. Hence not letting the money get into the hands of anyone and removing every possibility of it getting misused. Thus allowing us to reach to a logical solution to the problem in hand.
